# Weather-Dashboard

With the integrationof a Third-party API I created a custom weather dashboard. The user has the ability to search by city and is presented with the current weather for that city as well as a five-day forecast for the selected city. The user is provided with the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, UV and an icon to indicate the current and projected weather. The current search is saved in the search history, giving the user the ability to  toggle back and forth between selected cities and is presented with each cities current conditions.
